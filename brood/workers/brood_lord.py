class BroodLord():
    '''Reads the environmental set points, schedules their updates and sends them
    via queue() to controller. Class also controls the egg moving depending in config.
    Stepper driver was set to Vref: 0.74V with a 1.5A stepper motor. This model's
    step angle is 1.8Â°, so 200 steps are needed to complete a round in full step mode.
    Step mode was set to 101 (32 microsteps/step) by pulling up M0 and M2 pins.
    Step delay identified according to step angle. Direction pin is not defined.
    Driver is set to sleep after each moving to save energy and lower usage time.
